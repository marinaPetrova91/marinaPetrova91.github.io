                        <h2>6 Signs That You Are Not Meant to Be a Programmer</h2>

                    <p class="content">
                        Not everyone is cut out to be a programmer. Sure, anyone can learn how to program, but learning how to program is not the same as making a career out of it. In fact, it's entirely possible to be a talented coder and still be a mismatch for the career. It sounds strange, I know, but it's truer than you might think.

                        I spent over a decade earning a degree in computer science and thinking it was the career for me only to realize that it wasn't - and that's coming from someone who enjoys the programming workflow and the associated challenges.

                        There's more to it than the act of coding. You have to consider the entire picture. If you aren't completely sure that you're meant to be a programmer, here are some signs that may point you in the right direction.
